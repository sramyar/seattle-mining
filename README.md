# Installation
Python 3 is used for coding. Packages used are numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

# Motivation
Using Seattle Airbnb listings data to answer the following questions:

1. Can we categorize neighborhood vibes using the available data? What is each neighborhood's vibe?
2. What are the busiest times in Seattle? How do prices change in the high season?
3. Can we diagnose some long-term trends in terms of demand and supply for airbnb listings in Seattle?

# Descriptions

There is a jupyter notebook that contains the code for data analysis.

# Results
The findings are posted on this [article](https://medium.com/@sepehr.ramyar/seattle-rediscovered-88352cb7a157) in medium.

# Acknowledgments
Credits must be given to StacOverflow for the data. Also thanks to Udacity for the introducing the concepts. Clustering method was introduced in this [article](https://medium.com/@MSalnikov/text-clustering-with-k-means-and-tf-idf-f099bcf95183)
